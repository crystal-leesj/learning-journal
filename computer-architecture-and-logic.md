# How Computer Work

## What makes a Computer, a Comptuer?
- **Input**
  - Take input
- **Storage**
  - Store Information
- **Processing**
  - Processing it
- **Output**
  - Output the result

***

## Binary & Data
- Wire & Circuits
  - Carry all the information in a computer

### Bit
- the smallest piece of information a computer can store
- With more bits you can represent more complex **inforamtion**

```
computers represent numbers, words, images, and sound.
```

***

## Circuits and Logic
- Input and Output are Information
- A simple circuit takes an electric signal and flips it
- A "NOT" circuit takes an electric signal and flips it
- Complicated circutis take Multiple signals & combine them to give different results
- Electricity moves at just about the speed of light
- Modern circuits can perform billions of calculations per second

***

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output
- Input
  - Coverts physical input to binary information
- Memory
  - Stores information
- CPU
  - Central processing unit calculates information
- Output
  - Converts information to physical output
 
```
Sendor are input devices
Speakers, 3D Printers are output devices
```

## Hardware and Software
- Hardware
  - Circuits
  - Chips
  - Wires
  - Speakers
  - Plugs
  - Stuff
- Software
  - Apps
  - Games
  - Websites
  - Maps
  - Creatie
  - Analysis

#### CPU - Master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
 - math and logic
 - send and recive
 
### Operating system
- The master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
