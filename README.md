### 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset

 - I try to finish any task that is hard and challenging. Whenever I have a chance to organize my schedule, I list the task from the hard to the easy. Then I start to tackle one by one. If I skip the challenging task, my mind becomes unhealthy. I get stressed over the fact that I still have to do the task. So it is better to finish it before I get worried something that I can do.

- When it comes to a challenge or an obstacle, I try to keep myself from the excessive stress. I need to tell myself to take a break whenever it is needed. For example, there is a coding challenge that I cannot solve. I could spend about couple hours to solve the problem. If it does not get any better, I would step a side from the problem. Taking a walk and getting fresh air might help. This way, I would not get any unnecessarily negativity and stress.

- Expressing my idea and thoughts are important. But I need to keep myself from accepting otherâ€™s opinion. There are always more than one way of solving a problem. If I have a fixed mindset, I would not be able to grow my scope of learning experience.
