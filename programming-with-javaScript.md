## The ABC of Programming
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.
-To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).


### Expressions
- An **expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE


### Operators
- Expressions rely on things called **operators**; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.


### Arithmetic Operators
Name | Operator | Purpose | Example | Result
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------
ADDITION | `+` | Adds one value to another | 10 + 5 | 15
SUBTRACTION | `-` | Subtracts one value from another | 10 - 5 | 5
DIVISION | `/` | Divides two values | 10 / 5 | 2
MULTIPLICATION | `*` | Multiplies t wo values using an asterisk | 10 * 5 | 50
INCREMENT | `++` | Adds one to the current number | 10 += 1 | 11
DECREMENT | `--` | Subtracts one from the current number | 10 -= 1 | 9
MODULUS | `%` | Divides two values and returns the remainder | 10 % 3 | 1

### Function
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

### Declaring a Function
- To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.

### Calling a Function
- Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curlt braces with just one line of code.

### Declaring functions that need information
- Somtimes a function needs specific information to perform its task. In sich cases, when you declare the function you give it **parameters**. Inside the function, the parameters act like variables.

### Calling functions that need information
- When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called **arguments**, and they can be provided as values or as variables.

### Gettinh a single value out of a function
- Some functions return information to the code that called them. For example, when they perform a calculation, they return the results.
