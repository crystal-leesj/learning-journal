## The ABC of Programming
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.
-To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).


### Expressions
- An **expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE


### Operators
- Expressions rely on things called **operators**; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.


### Arithmetic Operators
Name | Operator | Purpose | Example | Result
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------
ADDITION | `+` | Adds one value to another | 10 + 5 | 15
SUBTRACTION | `-` | Subtracts one value from another | 10 - 5 | 5
DIVISION | `/` | Divides two values | 10 / 5 | 2
MULTIPLICATION | `*` | Multiplies t wo values using an asterisk | 10 * 5 | 50
INCREMENT | `++` | Adds one to the current number | 10 += 1 | 11
DECREMENT | `--` | Subtracts one from the current number | 10 -= 1 | 9
MODULUS | `%` | Divides two values and returns the remainder | 10 % 3 | 1
