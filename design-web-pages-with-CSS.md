## Color

### CSS associates style rules with HTML elements
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a *selector* and a *declaration*.

### CSS properties affect how elements are displayed
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a *property* and a *value*, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

### Summary
- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
